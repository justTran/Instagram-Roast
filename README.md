# Instagram-Roast
Bot to analyze photos and upload the best or worst photo to instagram

Training model (popularity determiner) was forked from https://github.com/dingkeyan93/Intrinsic-Image-Popularity, not made by me. All credit to original programmers.

Only code I wrote was a GUI to select directory and upload to instagram with selenium, since Instagram's API is not helpful for my purposes.
